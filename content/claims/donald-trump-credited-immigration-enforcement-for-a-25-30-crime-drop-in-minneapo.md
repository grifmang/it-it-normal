summary: >-
  Donald Trump claimed that immigration enforcement led to a 25-30% reduction in
  crime in Minneapolis. Available crime data from Minneapolis does not show a
  crime reduction of this magnitude in the timeframe associated with increased
  immigration enforcement operations. Multiple fact-checking organizations have
  examined this claim and found it inconsistent with official crime statistics.
