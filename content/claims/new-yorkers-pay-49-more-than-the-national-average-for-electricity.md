slug: new-york-electricity-costs-49-percent-higher
topic: energy
status: mixed
summary: >-
  New York electricity rates have consistently ranked among the highest in the
  United States, with residential rates significantly above the national
  average. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows New York's
  residential electricity prices have ranged from approximately 40% to 70%
  higher than the national average in recent years, with the specific percentage
  varying by time period and rate measurement method. The 49% figure falls
  within the observed range but represents a specific snapshot rather than a
  constant differential.

evidenceFor:
  - >-
    U.S. Energy Information Administration data consistently shows New York
    residential electricity rates ranking in the top 10 highest states
    nationally
  - >-
    Historical EIA data indicates New York residential rates have exceeded the
    national average by percentages ranging from approximately 40% to 70%
    depending on the measurement period
  - >-
    New York's average residential electricity price has been documented at
    levels supporting a differential in the range of 49% during certain time
    periods
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    The specific percentage differential between New York and national average
    electricity rates fluctuates monthly and annually, making any single
    percentage figure a snapshot rather than a constant
  - >-
    The claim does not specify whether it refers to residential, commercial, or
    industrial rates, which have different price structures and differentials
  - >-
    The claim does not specify the time period for the comparison, and
    electricity rate differentials vary by season and year
  - >-
    Different measurement methods (cents per kilowatt-hour vs. average monthly
    bills) can yield different percentage comparisons

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    New York electricity rates are demonstrably higher than the national
    average, though the precise percentage varies by time period and measurement
    method
  - >-
    A claim of 49% higher costs falls within the documented range of
    differentials between New York and national average electricity prices
  - >-
    The accuracy of the specific 49% figure depends on the time period
    referenced, the type of electricity rate measured (residential vs.
    commercial vs. industrial), and the calculation method used
  - >-
    Electricity rate comparisons require specification of time period and rate
    type to evaluate precision, though the general pattern of New York having
    significantly higher-than-average rates is well-established
