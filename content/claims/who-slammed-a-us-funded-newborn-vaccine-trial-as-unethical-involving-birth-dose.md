summary: >-
  The WHO did issue concerns about a CDC-funded hepatitis B vaccine trial in
  Guinea-Bissau, but the characterization requires context. WHO's primary
  concern centered on ethical and procedural issues with the trial design,
  particularly regarding informed consent and study methodology, rather than
  opposition to hepatitis B vaccination itself. The CDC received approximately
  $1.6 million in funding for vaccine research in Guinea-Bissau.
