# Crime in Minneapolis is down 25-30% because of immigration enforcement removing thousands of criminals from the area

## Overview

This claim was made during a Fort Bragg rally and subsequently fact-checked by PolitiFact. It contains two distinct assertions: a 25-30% reduction in Minneapolis crime, and a causal relationship between that reduction and immigration enforcement operations that allegedly removed thousands of criminals from the area.

## The Evidence

### Crime Statistics

Minneapolis Police Department maintains public crime data dashboards that track various crime categories over time. To verify a 25-30% crime reduction claim requires:

- Establishing the baseline time period for comparison
- Defining which crime categories are included (violent crime, property crime, total crime)
- Accounting for seasonal variations and reporting changes

[Note: Specific crime statistics for the claimed time period require verification from official Minneapolis Police Department sources]

### Immigration Enforcement Data

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducts enforcement operations in multiple jurisdictions including the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Verifying the "thousands of criminals removed" claim requires:

- Official ICE arrest and removal data for the Minneapolis area
- Specific time period for the operations
- Distinction between individuals with criminal records versus administrative immigration violations
- Geographic scope (Minneapolis proper versus broader metropolitan area)

[Note: Specific ICE operation numbers for Minneapolis require verification from official federal sources]

### Causal Connection

Establishing causation between immigration enforcement and crime rate changes requires:

- Temporal correlation showing crime changes following specific enforcement operations
- Controlling for other factors affecting crime rates (police staffing, community programs, economic conditions)
- Analysis of which specific crimes decreased and whether they match the profile of removed individuals
- Peer-reviewed research or official analysis connecting the two phenomena

No verified source currently establishes this causal relationship for Minneapolis.

## Key Questions

1. **What is the actual change in Minneapolis crime rates?** Official police data is needed for the specific time period referenced in the claim.

2. **How many individuals were removed through immigration enforcement?** Official ICE data would specify arrests, removals, and criminal history of those removed from the Minneapolis area.

3. **What evidence links the two phenomena?** The claim asserts causation, which requires more than temporal coincidence.

4. **What time period is being referenced?** The claim does not specify when the alleged 25-30% reduction occurred or over what time frame.

## Context

Crime rate changes in major cities result from multiple intersecting factors including:

- Law enforcement strategies and resource allocation
- Economic conditions and employment rates
- Community intervention programs
- Seasonal patterns
- Changes in reporting practices or definitions
- Demographic shifts
- State and local policy changes

Attributing crime rate changes to a single cause without rigorous analysis and controlling for confounding variables is methodologically problematic.

## What We Don't Know

- The specific time period for the claimed crime reduction
- Official crime statistics showing a 25-30% reduction
- Exact numbers of immigration enforcement removals in Minneapolis
- Any official analysis connecting immigration enforcement to crime rate changes
- Whether the claim references total crime or specific categories

## Conclusion

The claim requires verification on two levels: the factual assertion about crime rates and the causal assertion about immigration enforcement. Without official data supporting both the magnitude of crime reduction and the causal mechanism, the claim remains unsupported by available evidence.
