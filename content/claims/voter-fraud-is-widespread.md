whatThisMeans:
  - "Voter fraud exists but has been consistently documented at rates far too low to affect election outcomes"

  - "Courts have repeatedly rejected legal claims of widespread fraud for lack of evidence"
  - "Both the rarity of fraud and the existence of isolated cases are simultaneously true"
