    Multiple news outlets reportedly covered TSA agents working without pay

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    TSA agents are classified as essential personnel under federal law, meaning
    they must continue working during funding lapses even when paychecks are
    delayed
  - >-
    A funding lapse affecting DHS would impact approximately 260,000 employees,
    including TSA agents at airports nationwide
  - >-
    Essential employees who work during shutdowns historically receive back pay
    once Congress passes appropriations, though the timing of payment can create
    financial hardship
  - >-
    Partial government shutdowns affecting specific agencies like DHS differ
    from full government shutdowns in scope but have similar effects on affected
    employees
