title: Trump credited immigration enforcement for a 25-30% crime drop in Minneapolis
slug: trump-minneapolis-crime-drop-immigration-claim
topic: immigration
status: unsupported
summary: >-
  Trump claimed that immigration enforcement led to a 25-30% reduction in crime
  in Minneapolis. Available crime data from Minneapolis Police Department does
  not show a crime reduction of this magnitude in the timeframe suggested, and
  no direct causal link between immigration enforcement operations and city-wide
  crime statistics has been established in official reports.
