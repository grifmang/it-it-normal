  FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson sent a letter to Apple regarding Apple News
  content curation, but the letter's characterization as a formal legal warning
  is disputed. The letter questioned whether Apple's editorial choices in Apple
  News could potentially violate antitrust laws, though legal experts note the
  FTC typically lacks jurisdiction over editorial decisions and the letter did
  not cite specific violations or initiate formal enforcement action.
