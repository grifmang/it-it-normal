  ICE plans to spend $38.3 billion converting warehouses into detention centers,
  which is more than the annual budgets of 22 states

topic: immigration
status: mixed
summary: >-
  ICE planning documents do reference $38.3 billion in projected costs for
  detention operations, but this figure represents total detention capacity
  expansion costs over multiple years, not solely warehouse conversions. The
  comparison to 22 state budgets requires verification of which states and which
  fiscal years are being referenced.

evidenceFor:
  - >-
    ICE planning documents contain a $38.3 billion figure related to detention
    expansion according to Washington Post reporting
  - >-
    Multiple U.S. states have annual budgets below $38.3 billion, making the
    numerical comparison plausible
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    The $38.3 billion figure appears to represent multi-year projected costs for
    detention capacity expansion, not a single-year expenditure
  - >-
    The characterization as specifically 'converting warehouses' may
    oversimplify a broader detention facility expansion plan that could include
    various facility types and construction methods
  - >-
    Without specific identification of which 22 states and which budget years,
    the state budget comparison cannot be independently verified
  - >-
    ICE's annual budget has historically been in the range of $8-9 billion,
    making a single-year $38.3 billion expenditure unlikely without additional
    appropriations

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The claim contains a verified dollar figure from ICE planning documents but
    may conflate multi-year projected costs with annual spending
  - >-
    The specific characterization as 'warehouse conversions' requires additional
    documentation to determine if this accurately describes the planned facility
    types
  - >-
    The state budget comparison, while numerically plausible, cannot be assessed
    without knowing which states and fiscal years are being compared
  - >-
    ICE detention capacity expansion represents a significant increase in
    enforcement infrastructure spending compared to historical funding levels
