  violating Army policy prohibiting partisan displays

topic: military
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  The claim references an alleged event at Fort Bragg (now Fort Liberty) where
  Trump reportedly told soldiers to vote GOP. Without verified documentation of
  the specific event date, Trump's exact statements, and official military
  response, the claim cannot be fully assessed. Army regulations do prohibit
  active-duty personnel from partisan political activity in uniform and restrict
  partisan events at military installations.
