status: mixed
summary: >-
  A Democratic congressional report found that certain deportation operations
  under the Trump administration cost approximately $1 million per person in
  specific cases involving flights to distant countries. However, this figure
  represents an outlier scenario involving charter flights to remote
  destinations, not typical deportation costs, which average significantly
  lower.
