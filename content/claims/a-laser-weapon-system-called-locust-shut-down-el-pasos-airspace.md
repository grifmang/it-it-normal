title: A laser weapon system called LOCUST shut down El Paso's airspace
slug: locust-laser-weapon-el-paso-airspace
topic: defense
status: unsupported
summary: >-
  The claim asserts that a laser weapon system called LOCUST caused an airspace
  closure over El Paso. While El Paso International Airport experienced an
  airspace closure in January 2025, available evidence indicates this was due to
  an unidentified object, not a laser weapon system called LOCUST. LOCUST is a
  real U.S. Navy drone swarm system, not a laser weapon, and no credible sources
  confirm its involvement in the El Paso incident.

    unidentified objects, or military operations, but attribution requires
    official confirmation
