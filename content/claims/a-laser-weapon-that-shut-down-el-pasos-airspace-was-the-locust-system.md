evidenceFor:
  - >-
    Axios report allegedly identifies the system as LOCUST [pending
    verification]
  - >-
    El Paso airspace closure occurred in February 2026 [pending confirmation of
    specific dates]
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    LOCUST traditionally refers to 'Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarming
    Technology,' a Navy drone swarm system, not a laser weapon 
  - >-
    No publicly available documentation confirms LOCUST system has laser weapon
    capabilities

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The acronym LOCUST has been associated with Navy drone swarm technology
    rather than laser weapons in previous public documentation
  - >-
    If the laser weapon is indeed called LOCUST, it would represent either a
    different system sharing the same acronym or a significant evolution of the
    original drone program
  - >-
    Airspace closures due to weapons testing or incidents typically involve
    coordination between military authorities and the FAA
  - >-
    Verification requires access to official military system designations and
    FAA closure documentation
