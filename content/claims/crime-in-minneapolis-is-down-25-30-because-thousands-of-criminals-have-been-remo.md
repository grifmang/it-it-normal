topic: immigration
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  The claim states that Minneapolis experienced a 25-30% reduction in crime due
  to removal of thousands of individuals through immigration enforcement. While
  Minneapolis crime statistics and immigration enforcement data exist
  separately, establishing a direct causal relationship between immigration
  enforcement operations and the specific crime reduction percentage requires
  verification of the timeframe, crime data methodology, and enforcement numbers
  cited.
