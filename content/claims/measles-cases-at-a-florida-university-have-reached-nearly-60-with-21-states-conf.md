whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through
    respiratory droplets and can lead to serious complications including
    pneumonia and encephalitis
  - >-
    University settings present elevated transmission risk due to congregate
    living arrangements and close contact between students
  - >-
    CDC typically updates measles surveillance data on a regular schedule, with
    confirmed case counts reported by state and local health departments
  - >-
    Measles outbreaks in multiple states would represent a significant public
    health concern given the disease's high transmission rate and potential
    severity
  - >-
    Verification of specific case numbers requires official confirmation from
    state health departments or CDC surveillance systems rather than news
    reports alone
