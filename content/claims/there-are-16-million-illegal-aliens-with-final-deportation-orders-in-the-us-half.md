  ICE officials have stated that approximately 1.6 million individuals in the
  U.S. have final removal orders. The claim about half having criminal
  convictions appears to conflate two distinct populations: those with final
  removal orders and the broader 'non-detained docket' that ICE tracks, which
  includes individuals at various stages of immigration proceedings.
