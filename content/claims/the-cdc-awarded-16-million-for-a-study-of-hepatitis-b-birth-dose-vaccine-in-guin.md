  The CDC awarded $1.6 million for a study of hepatitis B birth dose vaccine in
  Guinea-Bissau that the WHO has slammed as 'unethical'

status: mixed
summary: >-
  The CDC provided funding for a randomized controlled trial studying the timing
  of hepatitis B vaccination in newborns in Guinea-Bissau. The WHO issued a
  statement in early 2025 criticizing the study's ethics, specifically the
  randomization of newborns into groups receiving different vaccination
  schedules, though the characterization of the criticism as 'slammed' adds
  editorial framing not present in official statements.

    The claim contains factual elements about CDC funding and WHO criticism, but
    includes subjective language ('slammed') that characterizes the tone of the
    criticism
  - >-
    Randomized controlled trials in low-income countries raise ethical questions
    about withholding interventions from control groups, particularly when
    studying vulnerable populations like newborns
  - >-
    The specific funding amount and full context of the WHO's concerns require
    verification from primary sources to fully assess the claim's accuracy
  - >-
    Ethical oversight of international research involves multiple levels of
    review including local ethics boards, institutional review boards, and
    international health organizations
