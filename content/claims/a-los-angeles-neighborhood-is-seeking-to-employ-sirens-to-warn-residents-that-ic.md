  A neighborhood council in the Pico-Union area of Los Angeles proposed
  installing a community alert system to warn residents of immigration
  enforcement activity. The proposal discussed using air raid-style sirens or a
  text messaging system, but no sirens have been installed as of early 2025. The
  neighborhood council voted to explore the concept but implementation faces

  - >-
    Council members proposed using air raid-style sirens as one potential method
    for the alert system
  - >-
    The neighborhood council voted to explore options for creating such a
    warning system
  - >-
    Los Angeles is a sanctuary city with policies limiting local cooperation
    with federal immigration enforcement
evidenceAgainst:
  - No sirens have been physically installed or deployed as of early 2025
  - 'The proposal remains in exploratory or planning stages, not implementation'
  - >-
    Significant legal questions exist about whether such a system would

      Media coverage increases regarding the proposal following change in
      federal administration
whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    Neighborhood councils in Los Angeles have advisory roles and can propose
    initiatives, but implementation of major projects requires city approval,
    funding, and legal review
  - >-
    The proposal reflects concerns in immigrant communities about increased
    immigration enforcement activity under federal policy changes
  - >-
    A distinction exists between proposing or exploring a system versus actively
    deploying it; the claim uses 'seeking to employ' which accurately reflects
    the exploratory stage rather than active implementation
  - >-
    Legal challenges could arise if such a system were implemented, as federal
    law prohibits certain forms of interference with immigration enforcement
    operations
  - >-
    Similar community alert systems have been discussed or implemented in other
    sanctuary jurisdictions using mobile apps or social media rather than
    physical sirens
