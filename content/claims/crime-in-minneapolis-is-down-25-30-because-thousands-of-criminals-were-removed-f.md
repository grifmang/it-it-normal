  removed from the area through immigration enforcement

status: mixed
summary: >-
  Minneapolis has reported declines in certain crime categories in 2024-2025,
  while federal immigration enforcement activity has increased in the region.
  However, establishing a direct causal relationship between immigration
  enforcement operations and overall crime reduction requires analyzing multiple
  factors, including the timing of enforcement actions, the scale of removals,
  and pre-existing crime trends.

  - >-
    The total number of individuals removed through immigration enforcement
    represents a small fraction of the total population in Minneapolis [VERIFY
    specific numbers]
  - >-
    Crime reduction involves multiple factors including policing strategies,
    economic conditions, and demographic changes that pre-date recent
    enforcement [VERIFY specific contributing factors]
  - >-
    Not all individuals subject to immigration enforcement had criminal
    convictions or pending charges [VERIFY proportion with criminal backgrounds]

      reduction
whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    Correlation between two trends (increased immigration enforcement and
    reduced crime) does not automatically establish causation without
    controlling for other variables
  - >-
    Crime trends are influenced by multiple simultaneous factors including
    policy changes, economic conditions, seasonal variations, and long-term
    demographic shifts
  - >-
    The proportion of crime attributable to individuals who are undocumented
    immigrants versus the general population is a key factor in assessing
    whether removals could produce the claimed magnitude of effect
  - >-
    The timeline of when crime began declining relative to when enforcement
    operations occurred is critical to evaluating the causal claim
  - >-
    Verification requires specific data on: the number of individuals removed,
    their criminal histories, the specific crime categories that declined, and
    the timing of both trends
