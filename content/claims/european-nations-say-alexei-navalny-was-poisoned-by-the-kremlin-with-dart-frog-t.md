  European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog
  toxin
slug: navalny-dart-frog-toxin-poisoning-claim
topic: foreign_policy
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  This claim requires verification of recent European government statements
  regarding Alexei Navalny's cause of death and the specific toxin allegedly
  involved. Navalny died in February 2024 in a Russian prison, with Western
  governments attributing responsibility to the Kremlin, though prior poisoning
  incidents involved Novichok nerve agent rather than dart frog toxin. The
  specific claim about dart frog toxin and recent European statements needs
  verification from official government sources.

    The August 2020 Navalny poisoning was confirmed by the OPCW to involve a
    Novichok-group nerve agent, not dart frog toxin
  - >-
    Navalny died in February 2024 in a Russian prison; Russian authorities
    attributed death to natural causes
  - >-
    No widely reported European government statements as of early 2024 have
    specifically identified dart frog toxin as the cause of death

    If European governments have made recent statements about dart frog toxin,
    this would represent new information distinct from the confirmed 2020
    Novichok poisoning
  - >-
    Batrachotoxin and Novichok are chemically distinct substances with different
    mechanisms of action and detection methods
  - >-
    Official statements from multiple European governments would carry
    significant evidentiary weight if properly sourced and verified
  - >-
    The claim requires verification of both the existence of European government
    statements and the scientific basis for identifying dart frog toxin
