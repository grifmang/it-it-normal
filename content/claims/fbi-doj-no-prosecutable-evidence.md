status: mixed
summary: "This claim is frequently made in reference to various high-profile investigations. Whether the FBI and DOJ 'found no prosecutable evidence' depends on the specific investigation referenced. In several notable cases, investigations concluded without criminal charges, but this does not necessarily mean no evidence of wrongdoing was found — it may mean the evidence did not meet the legal threshold for criminal prosecution."

evidenceFor:
  - "In multiple high-profile cases, DOJ has declined to bring criminal charges after investigation"
  - "DOJ prosecution guidelines require a reasonable probability of conviction, not just evidence of wrongdoing"
  - "A decision not to prosecute is a formal exercise of prosecutorial discretion"
evidenceAgainst:
  - "Declining to prosecute does not mean no evidence was found — it means evidence did not meet prosecution standards"
  - "Inspector General reports have documented conduct described as 'serious performance failures' even when prosecution was declined"
  - "Civil liability, regulatory action, or congressional referral may still result from the same underlying evidence"
  - "Prosecutorial discretion involves judgment calls about resource allocation, jury prospects, and political considerations"
  - "In some cases, evidence was referred for other proceedings (civil, administrative, or state-level)"

    description: "This claim pattern recurs across multiple investigations; no single timeline applies"
whatThisMeans:
  - "A decision not to prosecute is a legal judgment, not a factual finding of innocence"
  - "The phrase 'no prosecutable evidence' conflates the absence of charges with the absence of evidence"
  - "Civil and criminal legal standards differ; evidence insufficient for criminal prosecution may still support civil liability"
  - "Context about the specific investigation is necessary to evaluate this claim accurately"
