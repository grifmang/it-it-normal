summary: >-
  The claim references a State of the Union address scheduled for February 24,
  2026, and suggests DHS funding is set to lapse around that time, potentially
  causing a government shutdown. Without access to current official government
  sources regarding FY2026 appropriations status or confirmed State of the Union
  scheduling, the specific timing and relationship between these events cannot
  be independently verified.

    If DHS funding lapses without new appropriations or a continuing resolution,
    designated essential personnel including TSA agents would continue working
    without immediate pay, while non-essential functions would cease
  - >-
    A government shutdown occurring during or immediately before a State of the
    Union address would create logistical and security coordination challenges,
    as Secret Service and other DHS agencies handle security for such events
  - >-
    The timing of appropriations lapses relative to major government events can
    affect public perception and political negotiations around funding bills
  - >-
    State of the Union addresses require joint session invitations from
