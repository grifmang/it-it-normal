summary: >-
  The NBA fined the Utah Jazz $500,000 in February 2026 for conduct detrimental
  to the league after the team rested multiple healthy starters in consecutive
  games. While the league cited violations of player participation policies, the
  NBA did not explicitly characterize the fine as an anti-tanking measure,
  though the timing and context of the roster decisions during a losing season
  contributed to this interpretation.
