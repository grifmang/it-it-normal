topic: immigration
status: mixed
summary: "The claim that President Obama deported more people than any other president requires context. Formal removal numbers under the Obama administration were historically high, but changes in how removals were counted — particularly the reclassification of border turnarounds as formal deportations — significantly inflated the figures compared to prior administrations."

    summary: "Analysis examining whether Obama's deportation numbers represent a meaningful increase over prior administrations when accounting for methodological changes."
evidenceFor:
  - "DHS statistics show over 2.5 million formal removals during the Obama administration (2009-2016)"
  - "Annual removal numbers peaked at approximately 435,000 in FY2013"
  - "These figures exceed formal removal counts under any prior administration"
evidenceAgainst:
  - "Starting in the mid-2000s, many border encounters previously classified as 'voluntary returns' were reclassified as formal 'removals,' inflating the count"
  - "When combining removals and returns (the historical standard), Obama-era totals are lower than some prior periods"
  - "Interior removals — deportations of people living in the U.S. — declined significantly during Obama's second term"
  - "The comparison depends heavily on which metric is used: formal removals only vs. total people compelled to leave"

whatThisMeans:
  - "The raw removal numbers under Obama were the highest on record, making the claim technically accurate by one measure"
  - "Methodological changes in how removals are counted make direct comparisons to prior administrations misleading"
  - "Interior enforcement decreased significantly during Obama's second term"
  - "The characterization depends on whether 'deportation' means formal removal orders or total compelled departures"
