  TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another government
  shutdown
slug: tsa-agents-working-without-pay-government-shutdown
topic: government
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  The claim states TSA agents are working without pay due to a government
  shutdown. Without current verification of an active shutdown in February 2026
  or confirmation of TSA employment status during such an event, this claim
  cannot be definitively assessed. Historical precedent shows TSA agents,
  classified as essential employees, have worked without immediate pay during
  past shutdowns.

evidenceFor:
  - >-
    TSA agents are classified as essential personnel within the Department of
    Homeland Security, which historically requires them to work during
    government shutdowns
  - >-
    During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, TSA agents worked without
    receiving paychecks on their normal schedule
  - >-
    Essential employees do not receive pay during the shutdown period itself,
    though they are entitled to back pay once appropriations are restored
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    No verified confirmation exists of an active government shutdown in February
    2026
  - >-
    Even during shutdowns, TSA agents receive back pay retroactively once
    appropriations are passed, though payment is delayed
  - >-
    The specific claim references 'another' shutdown, suggesting multiple recent
    occurrences, which requires verification

    description: >-
      Previous government shutdown began, lasting 35 days and affecting TSA
      agents

    description: 2018-2019 government shutdown ended; federal employees received back pay
whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    TSA agents are designated as essential employees under federal law, meaning
    they must continue working during funding lapses that constitute government
    shutdowns
  - >-
    During government shutdowns, essential employees work without receiving
    paychecks on their regular pay schedule, though they retain legal
    entitlement to compensation once funding is restored
  - >-
    Verification of this claim requires confirmation that a government shutdown
    is currently in effect in February 2026 and that appropriations for DHS and
    TSA have lapsed
  - >-
    The distinction between working without pay and working without immediate
    pay is significant for understanding the financial impact on affected
    employees
