  Crime in Minneapolis is down 25-30% because of removal of thousands of
  criminals from the area through immigration enforcement

summary: >-
  Donald Trump claimed that crime in Minneapolis decreased 25-30% due to the
  removal of thousands of criminals through immigration enforcement. Minneapolis
  crime statistics show crime rates have declined, but the available data does
  not support a causal connection to immigration enforcement removals, and the
  timeline and magnitude of enforcement actions do not align with the claimed
  crime reduction.

evidenceFor:
  - >-
    Minneapolis has experienced declines in certain crime categories in recent
    reporting periods
  - >-
    Federal immigration enforcement operations have occurred in the Minneapolis
    area
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    Minneapolis crime data shows crime trends that predate recent immigration
    enforcement intensification
  - >-
    The number of removals through immigration enforcement in Minneapolis has
    not been publicly documented as 'thousands' within the timeframe of the
    claimed 25-30% crime reduction
  - >-
    Crime statistics are influenced by multiple factors including policing
    strategies, economic conditions, and demographic changes, not solely
    immigration enforcement
  - >-
    No official Minneapolis Police Department or city government statements
    attribute crime reduction specifically to immigration enforcement removals
  - >-
    The 25-30% reduction figure does not correspond to overall crime statistics
    for Minneapolis in available reporting periods

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The claim combines two separate data points—crime reduction and immigration
    enforcement—without establishing a documented causal relationship between
    them
  - >-
    Crime statistics are complex and typically reflect multiple contributing
    factors rather than a single policy intervention
  - >-
    Attribution of crime changes to specific enforcement actions requires
    controlled analysis that accounts for other variables affecting crime rates
  - >-
    Without official data confirming the number of removals and direct
    correlation studies, the causal claim cannot be substantiated
