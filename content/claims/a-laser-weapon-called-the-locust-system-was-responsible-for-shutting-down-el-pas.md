  Paso's airspace

topic: defense
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  A claim circulated that a laser weapon system called LOCUST caused an airspace
  closure over El Paso. LOCUST (Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarming
  Technology) is a real Navy program focused on drone swarms, not laser weapons.
  The connection between any military laser system and an El Paso airspace
  closure requires verification.

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    LOCUST is a documented Navy program, but its official purpose relates to
    launching drone swarms, not laser weaponry, suggesting potential confusion
    between different defense programs
  - >-
    Military installations near El Paso do conduct weapons testing that can
    require airspace restrictions, making the general concept plausible but
    requiring specific verification
  - >-
    The lack of verifiable official statements from the FAA or Department of
    Defense makes it difficult to confirm the specific claim without additional
    documentation
  - >-
    Confusion between different military acronyms and weapons systems is common
    in defense reporting, requiring careful verification of technical details
