  The EPA has finished repealing the 'endangerment finding,' removing the U.S.
  government's legal power to regulate climate change

topic: environment
status: unsupported
summary: >-
  As of February 2025, the EPA endangerment finding has not been repealed. The
  2009 endangerment finding, which determined that greenhouse gases endanger
  public health and welfare, remains the legal foundation for federal climate
  regulations. Any attempt to repeal this finding would require a formal
  rulemaking process subject to judicial review under the Clean Air Act.

  - >-
    The Trump administration has announced intentions to reduce climate
    regulations [VERIFY - specific announcements needed]

evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    The endangerment finding is a formal rulemaking that requires a public
    comment period and scientific justification to modify or repeal
  - >-
    Any repeal attempt would face immediate legal challenges based on the
    Administrative Procedure Act and Clean Air Act requirements
  - >-
    The 2009 endangerment finding was based on extensive scientific evidence
    reviewed by EPA, and any withdrawal would require demonstrating the original
    science was flawed
  - >-
    No formal Federal Register notice proposing repeal of the endangerment
    finding has been published as of February 2025 
  - >-
    The endangerment finding survived previous legal challenges and was upheld
    by federal courts
  - >-
    Even if repealed, other legal authorities for climate action exist beyond

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The endangerment finding is a regulatory determination, not a law, but
    repealing it requires following Administrative Procedure Act requirements
    including scientific justification
  - >-
    Repealing the finding would require EPA to conduct a new rulemaking
    demonstrating that the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion
    that greenhouse gases endanger public health
  - >-
    Any repeal attempt would likely face years of litigation, as courts have
    established that agency actions must be based on reasoned analysis of
    scientific evidence
  - >-
    Even without the endangerment finding, Congress retains authority to
    legislate climate policy, and states maintain independent regulatory
    authority
  - >-
    The claim overstates current developments by stating the repeal is
    'finished' when no formal repeal process appears to have been completed
