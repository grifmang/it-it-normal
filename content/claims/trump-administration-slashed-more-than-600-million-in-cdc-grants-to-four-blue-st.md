evidenceFor:
  - >-
    Four states (Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington) had CDC
    grant funding paused by the administration, totaling more than $600 million
  - >-
    A federal judge in the Northern District of Illinois issued a temporary
    restraining order on February 14, 2025, requiring restoration of the funding
  - >-
    All four states affected by the funding pause voted for Democratic
    candidates in recent presidential elections
  - The funding was previously appropriated by Congress and signed into law
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    The administration characterized the action as a temporary pause rather than
    a permanent cut or slash
  - >-
    The restraining order is temporary and does not represent a final judicial
    determination on the legality of the funding action
  - >-
    The specific legal authority cited by the administration for pausing the
    grants requires additional verification

      restoration of CDC funding
whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The administration took action to pause congressionally appropriated funding
    that had been previously authorized through legislation signed by the
    President
  - >-
    The affected states took legal action arguing the pause exceeded executive
    authority, resulting in at least one successful temporary court intervention
  - >-
    The temporary restraining order requires restoration of funding pending
    further legal proceedings, but does not resolve the underlying legal
    questions about executive authority over appropriated funds
  - >-
    The term 'slashed' in the original claim may overstate the nature of what
    was characterized as a pause, though the practical effect on states was a
    halt to more than $600 million in funding
