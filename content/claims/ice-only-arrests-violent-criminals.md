evidenceFor:
  - "ICE leadership has publicly stated that enforcement priorities focus on public safety threats"
  - "A substantial percentage of ICE arrests involve individuals with criminal convictions"
  - "Policy directives have at various times prioritized individuals convicted of serious crimes"
evidenceAgainst:
  - "ICE arrest data consistently shows a significant portion of detainees have no criminal conviction"
  - "TRAC analysis found that in multiple recent fiscal years, over 30% of ICE arrests involved individuals with no criminal record"
  - "Enforcement operations frequently result in 'collateral arrests' — detention of individuals encountered during operations targeting others"
  - "Non-violent offenses including traffic violations and immigration violations are included in 'criminal' arrest statistics"
  - "The definition of 'criminal' in ICE statistics includes immigration offenses such as illegal reentry, which are themselves a consequence of immigration status"

whatThisMeans:
  - "ICE arrest data does not support the claim that only violent criminals are targeted"
  - "Enforcement priorities have shifted significantly between administrations"
  - "The definition of 'criminal' in ICE reporting includes a broad range of offenses, many non-violent"
  - "Operational realities such as collateral arrests mean enforcement actions regularly affect individuals beyond stated targets"
