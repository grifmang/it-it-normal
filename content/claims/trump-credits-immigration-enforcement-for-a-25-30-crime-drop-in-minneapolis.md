# Trump credits immigration enforcement for a 25-30% crime drop in Minneapolis

## The Claim

Former President Donald Trump stated that immigration enforcement activities led to a 25-30% reduction in crime in Minneapolis.

## Key Evidence

### Crime Statistics

Minneapolis experienced a reduction in overall crime rates. The specific percentage and timeframe require verification from official Minneapolis Police Department data.

**Source needed:** Official MPD crime statistics showing exact percentage decline and time period

### Timeline of Enforcement Activities

Federal immigration enforcement operations increased in Minneapolis following the start of the Trump administration in January 2025. The exact scale and timing of these operations require verification.

**Source needed:** ICE or DHS data on enforcement activities in Minneapolis

### Causal Analysis

According to the PolitiFact fact-check referenced in the source context, the claim was rated as wrong. Key issues with the causal claim include:

- The crime decline began before increased immigration enforcement
- No statistical analysis supports a causal relationship
- Local law enforcement has not attributed the decline to immigration enforcement

**Source needed:** Complete PolitiFact analysis with methodology

## What Experts Say

[This section requires specific statements from criminologists, Minneapolis law enforcement officials, or academic researchers who have analyzed the data]

## Context

Crime rates fluctuate due to multiple factors including:
- Local policing strategies and resource allocation
- Economic conditions
- Seasonal patterns
- Community intervention programs
- Demographic changes
- Reporting practices

Establishing causation between a single policy intervention and crime rate changes requires controlled statistical analysis accounting for these variables.

## Verification Status

**Status: Unsupported**

The claim that immigration enforcement caused a 25-30% crime drop in Minneapolis is not supported by available evidence. While Minneapolis crime rates did decline, the temporal sequence and lack of corroborating analysis from law enforcement officials do not support a causal relationship with immigration enforcement.

**Key limitations:**
- Multiple URLs and specific data points require verification
- Exact percentage of crime decline needs confirmation from official sources
- Complete timeline of enforcement activities needs official documentation
- Statement from Minneapolis Police Department on contributing factors needed
