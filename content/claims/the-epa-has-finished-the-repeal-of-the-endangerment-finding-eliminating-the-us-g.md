title: >-
  The EPA has finished the repeal of the 'endangerment finding,' eliminating the
  U.S. government's power to regulate climate change
slug: epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-2026
topic: climate_policy
status: unresolved
summary: >-
  The claim references the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding, which determined
  that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare under the Clean Air
  Act. As of February 2026, reports indicate the Trump administration has taken
  steps toward repealing this finding, but the legal status, completion of any
  repeal process, and scope of regulatory authority elimination require
  verification.

    summary: >-
      2007 Supreme Court ruling that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse
      gases under Clean Air Act
evidenceFor:
  - >-
    The Trump administration has announced intentions to repeal or modify the
    endangerment finding [VERIFY - need specific announcement date and source]
  - >-
    Administrative action has been taken by EPA leadership to initiate repeal
    process [VERIFY - need documentation of formal Federal Register notice or
    similar action]
evidenceAgainst:
  - >-
    The endangerment finding is based on a Supreme Court interpretation of the
    Clean Air Act in Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), which requires statutory or
    judicial action to fully eliminate, not just EPA administrative action
  - >-
    EPA rulemaking processes typically require public comment periods,
    scientific review, and legal procedures that extend beyond simple
    administrative announcements [VERIFY - specific timeline for this action]
  - >-
    Other federal agencies beyond EPA have authority to address climate change
    under different statutory frameworks [VERIFY - scope of non-EPA federal
    climate authority]
  - >-
    State governments retain independent regulatory authority over greenhouse
    gases under certain circumstances [VERIFY - current status of state
    authority]

      Repeal process completion claimed [VERIFY - claim states repeal is
      'finished']
whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    The endangerment finding serves as the scientific and legal basis for EPA
    regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act
  - >-
    Repealing the endangerment finding would require EPA to demonstrate that the
    scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that greenhouse gases
    endanger public health and welfare
  - >-
    Even if EPA completes an administrative repeal, such action would likely
    face immediate legal challenges questioning the scientific basis and
    procedural compliance
  - >-
    Complete elimination of U.S. government power to regulate climate change
    would require more than repealing the endangerment finding, as authority
    derives from congressional statutes interpreted by courts
  - >-
    The claim's accuracy depends on whether the repeal process is actually
    complete, whether legal challenges have been resolved, and whether
    'eliminating power to regulate' accurately describes the legal effect
