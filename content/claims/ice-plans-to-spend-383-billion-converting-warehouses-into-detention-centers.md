    U.S. states
  - >-
    The documents represent internal planning for potential detention capacity
    increases under the Trump administration's immigration enforcement
    priorities
evidenceAgainst:

    The $38.3 billion represents estimated infrastructure costs in planning
    documents, not approved or allocated funding

    confirmed spending commitments
  - >-
    Congressional appropriation would be required for any actual expenditure of
    these funds
  - >-

whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    ICE has developed internal planning estimates for significantly expanding
    detention infrastructure, with costs projected at $38.3 billion

    or spending authority already granted by Congress
  - >-
    Warehouse conversions are identified as part of a broader detention
    expansion strategy that includes multiple facility types
  - >-
    Congressional appropriations would be required before any of these funds
    could be spent, making this a proposed cost estimate rather than committed
    expenditure
  - >-
    The scale of the estimated costs is substantial, exceeding the total annual
    budgets of nearly half of U.S. states
