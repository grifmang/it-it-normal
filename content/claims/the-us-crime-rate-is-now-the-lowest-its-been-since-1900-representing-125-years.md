summary: "The claim that U.S. crime rates are at their lowest point since 1900 requires context about which crime statistics are being referenced. While violent crime rates have declined significantly from 1990s peaks and recent data shows decreases in certain categories, comprehensive crime statistics from 1900 are not directly comparable to modern FBI data collection methods, which were not standardized until decades later. The specific claim of a 125-year comparison lacks the statistical foundation to be verified."

evidenceFor:
  - "Violent crime rates in recent years have shown significant declines from peaks in the 1990s according to FBI data"
  - "Certain crime categories including murder rates have decreased in recent reporting periods"
  - "Property crime rates have generally trended downward over recent decades"
evidenceAgainst:
  - "The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program was not established until 1930, making direct statistical comparisons to 1900 impossible"
  - "Crime data collection methods, definitions, and reporting standards have changed substantially over 125 years"
  - "Not all law enforcement agencies report crime data consistently, creating gaps in national statistics"
  - "The transition to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) in recent years has affected data comparability"
  - "Historical crime data from 1900-1930 is incomplete and based on different methodologies than modern statistics"

whatThisMeans:
  - "Modern crime statistics cannot be directly compared to 1900 because standardized national crime data collection did not exist until 1930"
  - "The claim conflates recent decreases in certain crime categories with a 125-year historical comparison that cannot be statistically validated"
  - "While recent trends show declines in violent crime from 1990s peaks, characterizing this as the lowest rate in 125 years exceeds what available data can support"
  - "Evaluating crime rate claims requires specifying which crimes are being measured and acknowledging limitations in historical data comparability"
