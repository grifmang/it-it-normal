whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    Deportation operations involving charter flights to third countries can
    incur substantial costs due to aircraft rental, security requirements,
    diplomatic coordination, and international agreements
  - >-
    Per-person cost calculations for individual flights may not represent
    average deportation costs, particularly when flights carry small numbers of
    individuals or involve unusual logistical requirements
  - >-
    Third-country deportation arrangements involve bilateral or multilateral
    agreements where the destination country is neither the United States nor
    the migrant's country of origin
  - >-
    Cost analysis of deportation programs requires distinguishing between
    variable costs (per individual) and fixed costs (per flight or operation) to
    accurately assess program efficiency
