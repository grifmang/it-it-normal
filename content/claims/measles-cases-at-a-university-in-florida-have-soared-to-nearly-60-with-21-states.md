whatThisMeans:
  - >-
    If accurate, nearly 60 cases at a single institution would represent a
    significant measles outbreak, as measles is highly contagious and was
    declared eliminated from the United States in 2000
  - >-
    Measles outbreaks typically occur in communities with lower vaccination
    rates, and universities can be vulnerable due to congregate living settings
  - >-
    The CDC and state health departments are the authoritative sources for
    confirmed case counts and would coordinate public health response to
    outbreaks of this magnitude
  - >-
    Verification requires accessing current CDC measles surveillance data and
    Florida Department of Health official announcements from February 2026
